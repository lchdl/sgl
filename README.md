## About SGL (Software Graphics Library)

<b>SGL</b> is a tiny, light-weight cross-platform (for Windows & Linux-based systems) <i><b>software rasterizer written in C++</i></b> by strictly following the classic GPU rasterization pipeline specifications with <i><b>skeletal animation support</i></b>.
Users can program their own <i><b>vertex and fragment shaders</i></b> and attach them to the pipeline to achieve custom effects.

* Currently used as my own retro-style game engine.

## Demos and tests
| Demo or test name |  Demo showcase  | Description |
|:------------------|:---------------:|:------------|
| `test_hello_world.cpp` | ![](https://github.com/lchdl/sgl/blob/develop/demos/test_hello_world.png) | A simple hello world demo. Demonstrating the <b>basic functionalities</b> of the rasterization pipeline (implemented in `sgl_pipeline.cpp`), including: perspective projection, basic texturing, custom vertex & fragment shaders. |
| `test_bone_anim.cpp` | ![](https://github.com/lchdl/sgl/blob/develop/demos/test_bone_anim.gif) | Skeletal animation & Assimp md5mesh import demo (model: <b>boblamp</b>, <b>1027 triangles</b>). Render time: <b>~1 ms</b> per frame in 320x240 resolution, <b>~3 ms</b> per frame in 800x600 resolution. |

## How to compile (CMake)

* <b>sgl</b> relies on these external libraries:

| Library |  Link  | Description |
|:-------:|:-------|:------------|
| SDL2 | https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL | Frame buffer visualization & window message loop handling. |
| Assimp | https://github.com/assimp/assimp | Model assets import. |

* Before `git clone` this repository, you need to <b>manually compile</b> all external libraries and remember the paths of all compiled libraries (\*.lib/\*.a/\*.so). 

### For Windows (Visual Studio IDE)
1. If you are using <b>Visual Studio 2017</b>, things will become much more simpler, I have provided the precompiled libraries, include headers, and all external dependencies in [<b>here</b>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11XBagdOkChDR2-2krSxKdTlhQcbmsMoI/view?usp=sharing) for download.
   
   > Otherwise you may need to compile all external libraries using other versions of Visual Studio.

2. Using CMake build system to generate Visual Studio solutions. Select "<b>x64</b>" platform. CMake will prompt you to <b>specify the path for compiled libraries and the location of include headers</b> (shown below).

### For Linux-based systems (g++ & make)
1. Manually compile all external libraries. I have provided the precompiled libraries in [<b>here</b>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hRSdiFgJHsPx1dYLDkSt6EPA2VP-0wnu/view?usp=sharing) for download.
2. Make sure your g++ compiler supports <b>C++17</b> language standard. I recommend using <b>ccmake</b> to generate makefiles. Create a new empty directory and `cd` into it, then
   
   > **ccmake \<path_to_sgl_CMakeLists.txt\>**
   
   to initiate CMake build system and configure the project. ccmake will also prompt you to <b>input the path of those precompiled libraries and include headers</b>.

## For developers
### Project structure
* CMakeLists.txt
  - For CMAKE.
* `demos/`
  - All demo outputs (*.png, *.gif).
* `include/`
  - Header files and inline implementations (*.h).
* `src/`
  - Source files (*.cpp).
* `tests/`
  - All CI test cases (*.cpp sources will be compiled and linked as executables).
* `doc/`
  - Documentations, devlog, tutorials, notes, etc.
* `res/`
  - Resource files (models, textures, etc.).
* `ext/` <i><b>(not included in this repo)</b></i>
  - External dependencies, including the source code for all 3rd-party libraries.
* `build/` <i><b>(not included in this repo)</b></i>
  - Project files generated by CMAKE/CCMAKE under different platforms.
  - For example, `build/gcc_x64_static/` stores all the project files generated for 64-bit gcc/g++ compilers, using static linking. `build/vs2017/` stores all the project files generated for the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
* `build_deps/` <i><b>(not included in this repo)</b></i>
  - Dependencies for building the project. Which contains:
    - Include headers of 3rd-party libraries.
    - Compiled libraries (*.lib/*.a) and shared objects / DLLs (*.dll/*.so).
  - Usually all the files in this folder are collected from `ext/`. You need to compile all the 3rd-party libraries in `ext/` and then copy the generated binaries and include headers to this folder.
