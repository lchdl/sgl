# About SGL (Software Graphics Library)

<b>SGL</b> is a tiny, light-weight cross-platform (for Windows & Linux-based systems) <i><b>software rasterizer written in C++</i></b> by strictly following the classic GPU rasterization pipeline specifications with <i><b>skeletal animation support</i></b>.
Users can program their own <i><b>vertex and fragment shaders</i></b> and attach them to the pipeline to achieve custom effects.

* Currently used as my own retro-style game engine.

# Demos and tests
| Demo or test name |  Demo showcase  | Description |
|:------------------|:---------------:|:------------|
| `test_hello_world.cpp` | ![](https://github.com/lchdl/sgl/blob/develop/demos/test_hello_world.png) | A simple hello world demo. Demonstrating the <b>basic functionalities</b> of the rasterization pipeline (implemented in `sgl_pipeline.cpp`), including: perspective projection, basic texturing, custom vertex & fragment shaders. |
| `test_bone_anim.cpp` | ![](https://github.com/lchdl/sgl/blob/develop/demos/test_bone_anim.gif) | Skeletal animation & Assimp md5mesh import demo (model: <b>boblamp</b>, <b>1027 triangles</b>). Render time: <b>~1 ms</b> per frame in 320x240 resolution, <b>~3 ms</b> per frame in 800x600 resolution. |

# Features and TODOs

  - Ray tracing

# How to compile (CMake)

* <b>sgl</b> relies on these external libraries:

| Library |  Link  | Description |
|:-------:|:-------|:------------|
| SDL2 | https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL | Frame buffer visualization & window message loop handling. |
| Assimp | https://github.com/assimp/assimp | Model assets import. |

* You need to manually compile these two libraries and link to <b>sgl</b>. 

## For Windows (Visual Studio IDE)
* If you are using <b>Visual Studio 2017</b>, things will become much more simpler, I have provided the precompiled libraries, include headers, and all external dependencies in here.
## For Linux-based systems (gcc + make)

# For developers
## Project structure
* CMakeLists.txt
  - For CMAKE.
* `demos/`
  - All demo outputs (*.png, *.gif).
* `include/`
  - Header files and inline implementations (*.h).
* `src/`
  - Source files (*.cpp).
* `tests/`
  - All CI test cases (*.cpp sources will be compiled and linked as executables).
* `doc/`
  - Documentations, devlog, tutorials, notes, etc.
* `res/`
  - Resource files (models, textures, etc.).
* `ext/` <i><b>(not included in this repo)</b></i>
  - External dependencies, including the source code for all 3rd-party libraries.
* `build/` <i><b>(not included in this repo)</b></i>
  - Project files generated by CMAKE/CCMAKE under different platforms.
  - For example, `build/gcc_x64_static/` stores all the project files generated for 64-bit gcc/g++ compilers, using static linking. `build/vs2017/` stores all the project files generated for the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
* `build_deps/` <i><b>(not included in this repo)</b></i>
  - Dependencies for building the project. Which contains:
    - Include headers of 3rd-party libraries.
    - Compiled libraries (*.lib/*.a) and shared objects / DLLs (*.dll/*.so).
  - Usually all the files in this folder are collected from `ext/`. You need to compile all the 3rd-party libraries in `ext/` and then copy the generated binaries and include headers to this folder.
